# <Book-Fitness>
## Description
We wanted to create an app that will give independent instructors and anyone in the wellness industry a better and easier way to connect with their clients without the need of using other methods of communication; as well as giving more freedoms to change their site to whatever they like, i.e adding their own scheduling apps. The past 5 days have been a massive learning experience. If we had more time than the 5 day sprint we had in class, we believe we could have depolyed a greater, more polished app for demonstrations.
